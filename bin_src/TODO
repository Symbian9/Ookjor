- for better re-use of the btengine classes	
	- make signal to save bt address of connected device in kasiditbtengine, not just write to file directly as in kasiditbluezengine, so prevdev.bdaddr can be saved/managed by app/engine to appropriate places - not by btengine.
	- change the way infomsgs are shown - use as signals and let main app/ookjorengine handle instead of show directly from kasiditbluezengine, so main app/engine can decide and show better custom message/pictures to help user overcome each step.

- kasiditbluezengine can probably be moved up into kasiditbtengine, so it's easier to make new bt stack handler engines

- separate kasiditbtengine into its own project and use as a shared-object/library + header so we/others can re-use it in many other apps dynamically






- make zoom on pc, widget should be resizable smaller than pic too
- make zoom on mobile
- make autofocus select on mobile (close-up/near, protrait, normal, infinite)
- make capture mode on mobile
- let mobile show viewfinder too, has/show option to enable/disable

- make better pc help
- make web with lots of pc and mobile screenshots in screenshots section
- make video camera how to use

done, short way - mobile better calculated relevant position of bitmap and labels
done - mobile aware bt not allowed on
done - showed note howto workaround already - mobile why first connect STILL fails from time to time - which times fials, which time doesn't? show help/notect - DETECT if no data for 2 sec then disc - WHY DISC from PC doesn't work? why must disc by turn mobile BT OFF only? Does this happen on E61 - yes?
done - showed note howto workaround already - mobile why first send obex fails - show note on obex? or make connection to device before obex - make obex feature internally? 5230 firmware issue?
